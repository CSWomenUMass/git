- Need to actually walk through the tutorial with someone -- if I delete the branch locally and then create it, git is smart and will layer these commands. What I want to illustrate is that someone who does not know that this branch exists should get an error saying that they haven't pulled when they try to push; then when they commit and pull, they will get a merge error. I think I would need to nuke the git history to get this working locally.
